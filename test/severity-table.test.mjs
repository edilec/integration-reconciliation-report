/**
 * The table against the documented catalog, in both directions.
 *
 * This is worth having and it is *not* the test that pins severity. A table, a
 * documented catalog and a hand-written expected map are three declarations
 * agreeing with each other, and a coordinated edit of all three passes every
 * assertion in this file. `test/severity-behaviour.test.mjs` drives real
 * inputs through the real binary and asserts the process exit code, and
 * `test/severity-word.test.mjs` asserts literal error counts and printed
 * severity words while sharing no map with anything.
 *
 * What this file is for: catching a rule that exists in the code and nowhere
 * in the documentation, or the reverse.
